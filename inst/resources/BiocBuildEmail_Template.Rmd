Hi %s,

I am contacting you concerning the `%s` package, on the %s
branch of Bioconductor, for which you are listed as the maintainer.

The latest build/check report shows that your package is failing on one or more
platforms.
Please resolve the issues before the next [Bioconductor release](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/release-schedule/)
for your package's continued inclusion in Bioconductor.

%s

Please let me know if you have any questions.

%s

Regards,


%s
